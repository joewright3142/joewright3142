- 👋 Hi, I’m @joewright3142
- 👀 I’m interested in modelling financial markets 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning implementation of Brownian motion/Gamma Variance models
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on integrating data into a decisioning model, perhaps, for example deciding when to exercise on options with early exercise features.
